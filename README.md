Feedr is a news aggregator that allows users to login with Google and choose amongst multiple media outlets to customize their news feeds, filter articles by search terms, and preview content with the option to visit original sources.

This project is in my portfolio because it reminds me of where I was just weeks after learning how to center a div. While putting together my portfolio website, I came across this early repo of mine and recognized it as a milestone in my journey as a web developer. Feedr marks my first use of **React**, **Firebase**, **OAuth**, and a variety of **RESTful APIs**.

The source code remains untouched since that initial experience teaching myself these technologies, most of which I now comfortably use on a daily basis. There were some particularly embarrassing error messages, however, which I refused to put my name on, so the latest commits attempt to silence those with patches, though others are beyond repair. At the time, I had no clue how to deploy, so I've also added hosting to put the app online.

Feedr is actually fully functional and serves some purpose, so I encourage you to play around with it. Don't pay much attention to the code, however, unless you want a lesson on the worse things one can do in React.

Revisiting this project encourages me to continue challenging myself because of the fast growth and future potential it showcases. I hope that putting it on display next to my more evolved projects reflects similarly.
